# RGB Color Guesser

This is a simple quiz game I created mainly to practice React. You can try out the latest version [here](https://arpi17.github.io/rgb-guesser).

The score is currently calculated by using the Euclidean distance to measure the [color difference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_difference)


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
